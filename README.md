# PowerShell-Scripts Repo
I am putting here some script that I use daily or less often. Since I don't want to recode over and over, I am putting these scripts here. 

It is nothing fancy, I just don't want to write them again. I might done rename and all without noticing anyone, and also if they don't work for you it's because maybe the script is not up to date.

* Azure > Azure script to interact with the WebApps and eventually more.
* Visual Studio
* RavenDB > Database where you have an access to the HTTP Api (Officially from 3.0+)
